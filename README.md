# 💰 MySusu – Blockchain-Powered Digital Savings Platform

> **Tagline:** *Save Together. Borrow Smart. Grow Wealth.*

MySusu is a blockchain-powered digital savings and lending platform designed to transform Africa’s traditional Susu (informal group savings) into a secure, transparent, and inclusive digital experience.

## 📘 Project Overview

Millions of Africans rely on informal savings groups due to limited access to formal banking. While these systems (called *Susu* in Ghana) are trusted culturally, they face significant issues:

- ❌ Lack of transparency and accountability  
- ❌ No formal credit history generation  
- ❌ Limited or no access to microloans or insurance  
- ❌ Poor record keeping and manual operations  

**MySusu** bridges this gap by preserving the simplicity of Susu while integrating modern technology like **blockchain**, **decentralized finance**, and **machine learning** for inclusive financial access.
